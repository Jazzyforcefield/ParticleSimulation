# Particle-Simulation
A revisit of assignment 1, this time using C++.

## What I Implemented
* Water
* Fire
* Translucent Particles
* Benchmark 100k water, 30k fire, up to you
* Some user interaction (press or hold N to change particle type)
* Camera (your camera)
* Bouncing off of wall and floor
* CCD
